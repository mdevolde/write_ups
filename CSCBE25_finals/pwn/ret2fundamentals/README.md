## How I solved it

### Goal

Exploit a vulnerability in the username handling logic to hijack program flow and call the hidden function `show_admin_key`, which reveals the flag.

---

### Step-by-step

1. **Initial interaction**
   - Send an initial username (`"test"`).
   - Choose option `1` to change username.

2. **Overflow to corrupt player struct**
   - A buffer overflow lets us overwrite fields in the internal `player` struct.
   - I crafted the following payload:

     ```
     [52 bytes of username] +
     [status = 0xcafebabe] +
     [balance = 0x41414141]
     ```

   - This likely tricks the program into thinking the user is VIP and Dev.

3. **Enter dev mode**
   - Use option `4` (VIP room), then option `5` to activate dev mode.

4. **Leak PIE base**
   - In dev mode, option `2` leaks the runtime address of `main()`.
   - Using the static offset of `main` from the ELF, I compute the base address of the binary (PIE base):

     ```python
     elf.address = leaked_main_address - elf.symbols["main"]
     ```

5. **Find the target function**
   - With PIE base known, I calculate the full address of the hidden function `show_admin_key`.

6. **Trigger function pointer overwrite**
   - Use dev menu option `3` to delete the player.
   - Use dev menu option `1` to reassign a username â€” but this is again vulnerable to overflow.
   - This time, I crafted a second payload:

     ```
     [52 bytes username] +
     [status = 0xcafebabe] +
     [balance = 0x41414141] +
     [4 bytes padding] +
     [8-byte address of show_admin_key replacing address of black jak]
     ```

   - The overwritten function pointer is normally used for the blackjack game.

7. **Hijack execution**
   - Exit dev mode and VIP room.
   - Call option `2` (play blackjack), which now jumps to `show_admin_key`.

8. **Retrieve the flag**
   - The flag is printed from the hijacked function.
